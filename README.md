# Movie-Recommendations-System
Project on Movie recommendation system using AI

Step-by-Step Guide to Run Your Movie Recommender Project
1. Set up your Python environment

First, you need to install the required Python libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install all dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Generate the model files             

The web application (app.py) depends on two files that are not included in your project: movies_list.pkl and similarity.pkl. These files are generated by the code in your Main.ipynb notebook.

You need to run the code from the notebook to create these files. You can either use a Jupyter environment or copy the code from the notebook into a new Python file and run it. The following code is extracted from your Main.ipynb file.

Save the following code as a Python script, for example, build_model.py, and run it from your terminal:

python build_model.py

This script will read dataset.csv, perform the necessary calculations, and save the two required .pkl files in the same directory.

3. Run the Streamlit web application

Once the movies_list.pkl and similarity.pkl files are generated, you can run the main application.

In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

This command will start a local web server and open the movie recommender system in your default web browser. You can then select a movie from the dropdown menu and click "Show Recommend" to get recommendations.
